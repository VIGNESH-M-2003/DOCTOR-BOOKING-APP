He filters the list based on his preferences, such as specialty, location, or availability.

Booking an Appointment: John finds a suitable doctor and clicks on "Book Now." A form appears where he selects the desired appointment date and uploads any necessary documents, such as medical records or insurance information.

After submitting the form, John receives a confirmation message indicating that his appointment request has been received.
